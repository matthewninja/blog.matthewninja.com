My girlfriend, Michelle will need to learn how to code for an upcoming course that she's taking as part of her Pyschology degree. We thought that me teaching her to code would be fun and productive. We made a youtube video out of it! Watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7USHtkZjvA

In our first lesson, we went over basic operations, methods/functions, variables, scoping, unit testing, and comparisons. I hope this is the start of something great!
