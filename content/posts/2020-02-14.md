## Private (serverless) Blog w/ Lambda@Edge
I wanted to make a private blog post with some thoughts that I don't necessarily want to make public to the universe. I'm also on a student budget, and don't want to spin up a dedicated VM to serve pages behind a password. I found [this post](https://hackernoon.com/serverless-password-protecting-a-static-website-in-an-aws-s3-bucket-bfaaa01b8666) on serverless, password protected static pages by [lmakarov](https://github.com/lmakarov).

Lambda@Edge allows one to use node.js or python Lambda functions through Cloudfront. If you're up to date with the serverless development environment, you might agree with me when I say that **serverless is the future**. I used a node.js for password-walling my secret blog.

Visit my secret blog at [secret.matthewninja.com](https://secret.matthewninja.com). Password required. If you know, you know.

## VendorPM Onboarding
I've been working for VendorPM remotely for 3 days now, since Wednesday. Today, I'm going into the office to be officially onboarded! Very excited.
