## Private (serverless) Blog w/ Lambda@Edge
I wanted to make a private blog post with some thoughts that I don't necessarily want to make public to the universe. I'm also on a student budget, and don't want to spin up a dedicated VM to serve pages behind a password. I found [this post](https://hackernoon.com/serverless-password-protecting-a-static-website-in-an-aws-s3-bucket-bfaaa01b8666) on serverless, password protected static pages by [lmakarov](https://github.com/lmakarov).

## Philosophy
My only two classes today were both Philosophy.

In the first class, Existentialism, we learned about Nietzsche and Nihilism.

In the second class, Critical Thinking, we looked at inductive reasoning.

## Computer Vision
My assignment for my Computer Vision class is no joke. 

The first part covers Convolutions. Seems easy enough.

## VendorPM Onboarding
I've been working for VendorPM remotely for 3 days now, since Wednesday. Today, I'm going into the office to be officially onboarded! Very excited.
