Today, I joined the awesome team at VendorPM to help their development. Also, because yesterday's IG effect so fun, I made another one today!

## Joining The VendorPM Team
Today, I joined [VendorPM](https://vendorpm.com/) as a developer. I'm going to be doing some front end work for them in react and graphql. It's only a short-term commitment, but I'm excited to get some diffs in!

I configured the codebase for testing today. The app uses React Router, so components require some state to test. I got around this by using Jest with Enzyme to unit test components. 

## Another Instagram Effect! Which Toronto Raptor Are you?
I'm still waiting for yesterday's effect to be reviewed and published so that I can share it. Spark AR says it usually takes 10 business days 😎. In the meantime, I got back at it! This time, I made the effect "Which Toronto Raptor Are You?"
